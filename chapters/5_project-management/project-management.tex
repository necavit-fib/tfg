This chapter discusses everything concerning the management of the project: \textit{scope}, \textit{schedule} and \textit{budget}. However, we must stress that this classical approach of management analysis is not really suited for our needs. Instead, a more \textit{Agile}\footnote{Agile software development is based on the \textit{Agile manifesto}~\cite{web:AgileManifesto}.} methodology will be applied. We cover this on the~\nameref{Management:Methodology} section, but there is an important conceptual change to be taken into account: the different driving force of the project. Whereas in classical project management the scope-schedule-budget triad is what must be controlled, in an Agile project management approach it is \textit{value}. Indeed, \textit{quality} must be ensured so maximum value is delivered to the project's stakeholders, thus being scope, cost and schedule just \textit{secondary} constraints to these primary goals.
