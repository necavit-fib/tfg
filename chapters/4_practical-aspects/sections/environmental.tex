\section{Environmental issues}
\label{Practical::Environmental}

No relevant direct environmental impact is related to this project, neither tied to its
development nor its further deployment. No use of massive resources is done and the
results of the work will not, presumably, result in a significant environmental change of
any kind.

It is still true, however, that data mining, as a discipline and its broad use, does
consume a lot of resources, in terms of technological infrastructure and energy. We cannot
forget that collecting, storing and processing data at the industry scale needs entire data
centers fully dedicated to the data mining process. Power consumption is a big concern
with nowadays information technology, as it is the huge amount of rare materials that
electronic devices contain. These are derived or indirect effects of the data mining process.
This issue deserves to be examined more closely, in the projectâ€™s final report.
