\section{Environmental issues}
\label{Practical::Environmental}

No relevant direct environmental impact is related to this project, neither tied to its development nor its further deployment. No use of massive resources is done and the results of the work do not, presumably, result in a significant environmental change of any kind.

It is still true, however, that \textit{data mining} as a discipline, does consume a lot of resources, in terms of technological infrastructure and energy. We cannot forget that collecting, storing and processing data at the scale that we have reached needs entire data centers fully dedicated to the data mining process. Power consumption is a big concern with nowadays information technology, as it is the huge amount of rare materials that electronic devices contain. These highlights are indeed indirect effects of the data mining process.
