\section{Legal framework}
\label{Practical::Legal}

One of the aspects to bear in mind when developing a technological project is the legal environment in which it is framed. We will 

Efforts are being carried out to develop legal frameworks to help protect people’s privacy, at many levels. One such example is the spanish LOPD, a law that aims, among other things, to define different data privacy levels and mandatory proceedings associated to each - no matter the medium used to transfer it or store it.

There are some pitfalls to these legislative efforts, though. Firstly, it is really hard to assess their accomplishment in the IT sector and, thus, it is sometimes a matter of confidence in the developer’s good practice. Another important drawback is that online services, such as social networks, can be accessed globally, but, on the other hand, their legislative framework is that of the country to which the backing company offering the service belongs to - jurisdiction definition in the Internet is still a matter of intense debate, nowadays.

Concerning the actual code base of the project, we must implement all necessary intellectual property protection measures. Because it is an \textit{open source} project, an internationally recognised software license will be included in the public code repository, hosted at GitHub\footnote{The project is available at \url{https://github.com/necavit/moa-ppsm}.}. The chosen license is the \href{http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT}{MIT License}, which has proven to be easy to understand, relatively widespread and quite permissive.

Within the project, no personal data has yet been used to perform any benchmarking process nor to assess the quality of the developed methods - random data generators are being used instead. However, if such data was ever used, it is clear that is should be under the terms of the spanish LOPD law and that, therefore, protection and security measures should be taken accordingly. It is unclear, at the moment, that any sensitive data set might be used throughout this project; many benchmark data sets available are free from any kind of sensitive, personal data.

We have not detected any other kind of legal consequences or regulations bound to this project's development.
