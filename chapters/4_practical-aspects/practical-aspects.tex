This chapter addresses the \textit{practical} aspects of this project, this is, all aspects that are related to the \textit{praxis}\footnote{\textit{Praxis} is the process by which a theory, lesson, or skill is enacted, embodied, or realised. \textit{Praxis} may also refer to the act of engaging, applying, exercising, realizing, or practicing ideas.}, rather than to technology or theory. An analysis of the concept of privacy and the need to protect it is given in the first section of the chapter, followed by a short review of the legal framework that applies to this project and, finally, a brief note on the environmental impact of the present work.
