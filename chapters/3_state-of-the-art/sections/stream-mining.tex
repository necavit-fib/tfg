\subsection{The MOA framework}
\label{State::StreamMining::MOA}

Because it is an incipient field, stream mining software packages are quite uncommon. Even though specific applications have been developed[6], MOA remains as one of the few generic, free and open sourced systems. One example of a commercial solution that includes support for data stream mining is RapidMiner.
In relation to MOA, a new project called SAMOA is being developed too, based on top of MOA itself, and a couple of streaming processing engines: Apache S4 and Apache Storm, developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
