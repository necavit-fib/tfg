\textbf{Privacy preserving \textit{Stream} Mining:} many of the previously listed methods are already implemented in many classical data mining frameworks and software systems; for example, the \texttt{sdcMicro} package for the \textbf{R} statistical package~\cite{sdcMicro}. However, privacy preserving methods are still not widespread in the stream mining ecosystem - that is another motivation for this project.
