What follows is a brief introduction to the project under review in this report and its context,
in a broad sense. The structure of this document is also outlined in the last section of this chapter.

\section{Context}
\label{Introduction::Context}

An overview is now given of the two main concepts that, when combined,
drive the motivation behind the inception and development of this project.

\subsection{Data mining}
\label{Introduction::Context::DataMining}

Information society produces vast amounts of data all over the world.
This data comes from innumerable sources and in diverse formats, and has been stored
for years in data warehouses, waiting to be processed. With the continuous increase
in computing power, due to the recent advances in software and hardware technologies,
the machine learning field, also known as \textit{data science}, has arisen,
allowing us to exploit this stored data and extract knowledge from it.

Data science is, indeed, a holistic process, where many different disciplines are
involved, from data acquisition and storage, through its selection, filtering and
analysis up to knowledge extraction, visualization and discovery.

\end{figure}

Data science enables a better understanding of human or natural processes and provides
us with means to identify trends, predict future events or discover useful patterns.
Its uses range from scientific and medical applications to social sciences or business
administration~\citep{Fayyad:FromDataMining}.

\subsubsection{Facing the limits}

Despite lots of efforts are put into enhancing different data mining processes, there still
are many cases where these techniques fail to perform well, mainly because of the scale of
the problems that we face nowadays.

On the one hand, traditional data mining workflows cannot cope with the really massive
data sets that are available nowadays, if performed on a common infrastructure.
To solve this issue, clusters of hundreds or thousands of computers are used to run
such analysis. It is costly and complex but, doing so, we can mine amounts of data in a way that
was unthinkable some time ago.

On the other hand, we face another type of scaling problem. In some situations, data
acquisition throughput is so high that it cannot be stored anyway, so another approach
is needed to avoid this loss of information, because we still want to analyze it to extract
knowledge from it. Both these scenarios are addressed with a
series of techniques known as \textit{stream mining}.

\subsubsection{Stream mining}

\textit{Stream mining} or \textit{data stream mining} is a process that allows us to
still discover knowledge and patterns in data, even when it comes in the form of a
continuous stream, or many of them~\citep{Rajaraman:MiningMassiveDatasets}. Instead of processing
all statically stored data, like traditional data mining does, a relatively small
portion of it is kept during the analysis, and it is updated when needed - either because
more resources are available to the system or because new data is acquired. A more deeper
review of this research area is given in \ref{Theory::StreamMining}.

\subsection{Privacy}
\label{Introduction::Context::Privacy}

Privacy is a concept that can be defined as the ability of an individual or group to
seclude\footnote{“Seclusion is the act of placing or keeping someone away from other people.”~\citep{web:Merriam:Seclusion}} themselves, or information about themselves, and
thereby express themselves selectively. It is understood differently depending on the social
and cultural background of each individual, but it is in fact recognised as one of the most
fundamental rights of our human nature. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights’ 12th
article~\citep{web:UN:HumanRightsDeclaration} states that:

\begin{quote}
	No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or
	correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to
	the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.
\end{quote}

This right has been continuously violated ever since information exchange and advanced
communication technologies have been developed. Despite this did not begin with the spread
of the Internet, its adoption has greatly magnified both the ability to breach people’s privacy
and the impact that these breaches have. A more thorough analysis of privacy and its interrelations
with society and technology is given in \sref{Practical::Privacy}.

\subsection{Privacy Preserving Data Mining}
\label{Introduction::Context::PPSM}

Nowadays, data mining technologies have become a relevant debate topic, concerning what
information is collected from individuals, who owns it and what are the purposes behind
its gathering. Information technologies deliver us many benefits at many levels - safer
streets, cheaper communications, better health systems, more convenient shopping - but
at the high cost of losing our privacy.

Knowledge discovery processes need data to work and, in most cases, it is sensitive and
personal. Moreover, it is massively collected, stored and analyzed without the users consent.
Besides this lack of consent in the data acquisition stage of the process,
data mining poses a bigger thread on individuals: information disclosure. Sensitive data
must be treated accordingly, which involves not only good IT security practices to avoid
information leaks, but a responsible treatment when research results are published.

\subsubsection{Statistical Disclosure Control}

\textit{Statistical Disclosure Control} (SDC) is the name that the statistical community
has given to what the data mining community calls Privacy Preserving Data Mining (PPDM).
This field, whatever its preferred name is, deals with controlling that information about
specific individuals is not extracted from statistical summary results. Also, if full
datasets are to be released, SDC methods should be applied to data in order to preserve
user's privacy, whilst maintaining the statistical significance of it, i. e., the amount
of information - knowledge - that this data can provide.

\section{The project: moa-ppsm}
\label{Introduction::moa-ppsm}

Having reviewed the main concepts to which this project is related to, we can now outline
its main purpose, once we take a closer look to the technical environment in which it
will be developed.

\subsection{MOA}
\label{Introduction::moa-ppsm::MOA}

\textbf{MOA}, initials for \textbf{M}assive \textbf{O}nline \textbf{A}nalysis, is an
open source framework for data stream mining~\citep{web:MOA}, originally
developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes several machine learning
algorithms\footnote{Algorithms used to perform the actual data mining analysis (the
“machine learning \& visualization” step on \fref{fig:data-mining}) belong to the
field of machine learning. In MOA, clustering, classification, regression, outlier
detection and recommender systems are available.} to perform the analysis and tools
to evaluate the quality of the results. It also deals with a problem known as
\textit{concept drift}\footnote{It is said of statistical properties of a target variable
being analyed, when they change over time in unforeseen ways.}. It is related to the well
known and commonly used Weka\footnote{Weka is a popular software package including
classical data mining algorithms, this is, not stream mining. It is also developed at
the University of Waikato.~\citep{web:Weka}} package, but it is built to perform at
a greater scale for more demanding problems.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{MOA filters}

One of the available features in MOA is the use of \textit{filters}, which can process
streaming data before or after being fed to other systems or algorithms, such as learners
or file writers. However, few filters are currently shipped within the latest MOA distribution,
namely a filter to replace \textit{missing values}\footnote{In statistics, missing data, or missing values,
occur when no data value is stored for the variable in an observation. Missing data are a
common occurrence and can have a significant effect on the conclusions that can be drawn
from the data.} and a filter that adds noise to data.

\subsubsection{MOA extensions}

When working with MOA, the environment consists of the core library, but \textit{extensions}
can be used to enhance the existing methods or to provide additional features, based on
the core tools that MOA already provides. A series of extensions have been developed and can
be found on MOA's website, at \url{http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/moa-extensions}.

\subsection{The project in a nutshell}
\label{Introduction::moa-ppsm::ProjectNutshell}

Summing up, the aim of this project is to \textbf{implement privacy preserving filters
for the MOA stream mining framework}. This is, adapt some well-known SDC methods to a stream mining environment and, more precisely, to the MOA software framework, in the form of a MOA extension.

\section{Report structure}
\label{Introduction::Structure}

The structure of this report gives an overview of the development process of the project, from the theoretical foundations that are necessary to understand the work to the final results and conclusions.

\cref{Chapter2TheoreticalFramework} covers the theory basis behind the SDC methods implemented in the project and provides some insights on different stream mining approaches. \cref{Chapter3StateOfTheArt} discusses state of the art solutions concerning SDC for static databases (not streaming data). \cref{Chapter4PracticalAspects} analyzes more thoroughly the motivation behind privacy-preserving data mining by discussing \textit{practical} questions like the relationship between society and privacy or the legal framework that applies to the context of this project. Project management is layed out in \cref{Chapter5ProjectManagement} and then the report turns to more technical related topics, such as implementation details and desgin decisions, covered in \cref{Chapter6ImplementingFilters}, as well as benchmarking, in \cref{Chapter7Benchmarking}. Finally, the report and project conclusions are given in \cref{Chapter8conclusions}, covering both achievements and possible future work.
